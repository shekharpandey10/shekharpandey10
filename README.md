## 🔍 Latest Project

### [Water Quality Prediction using Machine Learning]
This project aims to predict the quality of water using machine learning techniques. It focuses on building a model that can assess water quality based on various environmental factors such as pH levels, temperature, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, and more. By training the model with real-world data, this project helps in identifying potential risks and providing early warnings for water contamination.
**Technologies Used:**
- **Python** for data manipulation and model building
- **scikit-learn** for machine learning algorithms (e.g., regression, classification models)
- **TensorFlow** for deep learning models (if applicable)
- **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data preprocessing
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization



## 🌱 My Learning Path
- Building a solid foundation in **Data Structures** and **Problem Solving** for optimized coding.
- Learning **Java** and **Angular** for full-stack development, aiming to combine ML models with web applications.
